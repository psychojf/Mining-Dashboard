## How to Use


### Managing Characters


Your characters will be detected automatically from existing game logs.
Click the **gear icon** in the top-right corner to open the Config dialog.


- Check or uncheck characters to show or hide them on the dashboard.
- Adjust the **Gamelogs Path** if your EVE logs are in a non-default location.
- Set the **Update Interval** (how often the dashboard reads new log data, minimum 250 ms).
- Set the **Default History Days** for the history window.


### Configuring Ship Fittings


from the MAIN ui, right-click on a character's column and select **Ship Config** to open the fitting dialog.


- **Profiles**: Create multiple ship profiles (e.g. one for ore mining, one for ice, one for gas). Use the dropdown to switch between them.
- **Modules**: Configure up to 5 mining modules per profile. For each module, enter:
  - **Module Name** -- a label for your reference (e.g. "Strip Miner I")
  - **Yield (m3/cycle)** -- the m3 your module extracts per cycle (check your fitting window in EVE)
  - **Cycle Time (s)** -- the duration of one mining cycle in seconds
- **Enable/Disable**: Use the checkboxes to toggle individual modules on or off.
- The **Theoretical rate** preview updates live as you adjust values.
- Click **SAVE** to apply. The dashboard will now show theoretical m3/s and compare it to your actual mining rate during active sessions.


### Start monitoring


1. after setting up the "ship fitting" and the character you want to see on the Dashboard you are ready...
2. Click **START** under a character's column to begin tracking that session.
3. Mine as usual in EVE -- stats update in real time.
4. Click **STOP** to pause tracking, or **RESET** to clear all stats for that character.














### Viewing Mining History


Click the **HISTORY** button at the bottom of the dashboard.


- Enter the number of days to analyze and press Enter or click **REFRESH STATS**.
- The history window shows total m3 mined per character with a per-ore breakdown.
- Data is read from all game log files within the selected time range.


## Configuration File


Settings are saved automatically to `mining_config.json` in the same folder as the script. This includes:


- Window positions (dashboard, history, ship config dialogs)
- Character visibility selections
- All ship profiles and module configurations
- Application settings (paths, intervals, etc.)


Delete this file to reset everything to defaults.


## Supported Ore Types


The dashboard recognizes all major EVE ore categories including their grade variants (II-Grade, III-Grade, IV-Grade):


- **Standard ores**: Veldspar, Scordite, Pyroxeres, Plagioclase, Omber, Kernite
- **Low-sec ores**: Jaspet, Hemorphite, Hedbergite
- **Null-sec ores**: Gneiss, Dark Ochre, Spodumain, Crokite, Bistot, Arkonor, Mercoxit
- **Moon ores**: R4 through R64 (Zeolites, Cobaltite, Otavite, Carnotite, Xenotime, etc.)
- **Ice**: Blue Ice, Clear Icicle, Glacial Mass, White Glaze, and others
- **Pochven ores**: Bezdnacine, Rakovene, Talassonite
- **Gas clouds**: All Cytoserocin, Mykoserocin, and Fullerite variants
- **Special ores**: Ueganite, Prismaticite, Ducinium


## Tips


- The dashboard window is **draggable** -- click and drag anywhere on the background.
- The overlay is semi-transparent (85% opacity) by default.
- If a character's ship indicator diamond is **green**, at least one module is configured. **Red** means no modules are set up yet.
- The active profile name is shown in angle brackets next to each character's name.
- All window positions are saved between sessions.


## Troubleshooting


- **No characters detected**: Make sure EVE has been launched at least once and game logs exist in the Gamelogs folder. Check the path in Config if using a custom location.
- **Stats not updating**: Ensure the session is started (button should say "STOP"). The dashboard only tracks mining events while a session is active.
- **No sound on critical hits**: Be sure `alert_crit.wav` file in the same folder as the script. if not you can basicly put any wav file there as long as the name stil is "alert_crit.wav"
