## How to Use


### Managing Characters


Your characters will be detected automatically from existing game logs.
Click the **gear icon** in the top-right corner to open the Config dialog.


- Check or uncheck characters to show or hide them on the dashboard.
- Adjust the **Gamelogs Path** if your EVE logs are in a non-default location.
- Set the **Update Interval** (how often the dashboard reads new log data, minimum 250 ms).
- Set the **Default History Days** for the history window.


### Configuring Ship Fittings


from the MAIN ui, right-click on a character's column and select **Ship Config** to open the fitting dialog.


- **Profiles**: Create multiple ship profiles (e.g. one for ore mining, one for ice, one for gas). Use the dropdown to switch between them.
- **Modules**: Configure up to 5 mining modules per profile. For each module, enter:
  - **Module Name** -- a label for your reference (e.g. "Strip Miner I")
  - **Yield (m3/cycle)** -- the m3 your module extracts per cycle (check your fitting window in EVE)
  - **Cycle Time (s)** -- the duration of one mining cycle in seconds
- **Enable/Disable**: Use the checkboxes to toggle individual modules on or off.
- The **Theoretical rate** preview updates live as you adjust values.
- Click **SAVE** to apply. The dashboard will now show theoretical m3/s and compare it to your actual mining rate during active sessions.


## Fleet Mode

Fleet Mode lets you report mining session statistics directly to a Discord channel via webhook, making it easy to coordinate and share results during fleet mining operations.

### Setup

1. Open **Settings** and paste your Discord webhook URL into the **Webhook URL** field.
2. Enable the **⚓ Fleet** toggle on any character column to activate fleet reporting for that session.

### Sending Reports

Once Fleet Mode is enabled, two buttons appear per character:

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| **⎘ COPY** | Copies a plain-text session report to your clipboard |
| **▲ SEND** | Opens a confirmation dialog and posts a rich embed directly to Discord |

The **SEND** button is only active when a valid Discord webhook URL is configured.

### Report Contents

Each report includes:

- Character name
- Session duration
- Critical hit count
- Per-ore-type volume breakdown (m³ and unit count)
- Total volume mined

Discord reports are sent as formatted embeds with a timestamp.


### Start monitoring


1. after setting up the "ship fitting" and the character you want to see on the Dashboard you are ready...
2. Click **START** under a character's column to begin tracking that session.
3. Mine as usual in EVE -- stats update in real time.
4. Click **STOP** to pause tracking, or **RESET** to clear all stats for that character.


### Viewing Mining History


Click the **HISTORY** button at the bottom of the dashboard.


- Enter the number of days to analyze and press Enter or click **REFRESH STATS**.
- The history window shows total m3 mined per character with a per-ore breakdown.
- Data is read from all game log files within the selected time range.


## Configuration File


Settings are saved automatically to `mining_config.json` in the same folder as the script. This includes:


- Window positions (dashboard, history, ship config dialogs)
- Character visibility selections
- All ship profiles and module configurations
- Application settings (paths, intervals, etc.)


Delete this file to reset everything to defaults.
